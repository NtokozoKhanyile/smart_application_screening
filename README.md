## 🚀 Quick Start

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # Configure your database
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

The system uses **JWT tokens** for stateless authentication.

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **applicant** | Create/submit applications, upload documents, view own data |
| **admin** | All applicant permissions + review screenings, override decisions, view dashboard |

Example login flow:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
  -d "username=user@example.com&password=password"
```

Response:
```json
{"access_token": "eyJ...", "token_type": "bearer"}
```

Then use in all subsequent requests:
```
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

---

## 🎯 Application Workflow

```
1. Student registers & logs in
2. Student creates application (draft)
3. Student adds personal info + subject grades
4. Student uploads supporting documents
5. Student submits application → AI screening triggered
6. System evaluates grades against course requirements
7. Decision issued: APPROVED → NEEDS_REVIEW → REJECTED
8. Admin receives notifications for manual cases
9. Admin reviews, approves, or rejects
10. Student notified of final decision
```

---

## 🧠 Scoring Logic

The AI screening engine evaluates applications by:

1. **Checking minimum requirements** – Ensures all required subjects meet minimum marks
2. **Calculating weighted score** – Subject grades weighted according to course configuration
3. **Decision routing**:
   - ✅ **APPROVED** if score ≥ approval threshold
   - ⚠️ **REVIEW** if score is within 10 points of threshold (marginal cases)
   - ❌ **REJECTED** if score is below threshold or fails minimums

Admins can override any automated decision with notes for audit trail.

## 🧪 Testing

Run backend tests:
```bash
cd backend
pytest                          # Run all tests
pytest tests/test_application.py -v  # Run specific file
pytest --cov=app               # With coverage report
```

Tests cover:
- Authentication & authorization
- Application CRUD operations
- Scoring logic & edge cases
- Admin workflows
- Error handling

## 🛠 Development

### Adding a new feature:
1. Create database model in `backend/app/db/models/`
2. Create Pydantic schema in `backend/app/schemas/`
3. Create API route handler in `backend/app/api/routes/`
4. Generate and run database migration
5. Write tests in `backend/tests/`
6. Document in README

### Database changes:
```bash
cd backend
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
alembic upgrade head
```

---

## 📦 Deployment
